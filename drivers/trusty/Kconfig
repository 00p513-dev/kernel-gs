	  Trusty is a secure OS that provides a Trusted Execution Environment
	  (TEE) for Android.  Trusty runs on the same processor as Linux but is
	  isolated from the rest of the system by both hardware and software.

	  This option enables the core part of the Linux kernel driver for
	  Trusty.  This doesn't do much by itself; you'll need to enable some of
	  the sub-modules too.

	  If you build this as a module, it will be called trusty-core.
